# winky-bot
a simple discord selfbot written in discord.js

## how to run:
first, edit config.JSON with your discord token & ID (just google how to find them)
then, open a command prompt and run:
> node bot.js

***make sure you have nodeJS installed first***

## future plans:
1. moderation commands (kick, ban, mute, etc)
2. role creation
3. better embed command using flags
4. command parser using external js files
5. UI using electron
